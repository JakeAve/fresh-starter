# TODOS

- [ ] Email verification link could use the same function
- [ ] Dark mode
- [x] Verify email button in account
- [x] Encoding and crypto functions separate
- [x] Can only change email once a month
- [ ] Regular error handling shouldn't throw second error in the return response
      function. The error inside of an error pattern should be addressed.
